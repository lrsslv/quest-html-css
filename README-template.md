## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to better understand and improve my flexbox and grid skills. As they are still quite challenging to me, I still have a lot to improve in future projects, but I ended up being happy with the results for now. 
It was really nice to build the responsive view and I believe that the results were good as everything look very similar to what the chalenge asks, and the hover functions works well.

### Continued development

As said before, I need to get more familiar with flexbox and grid concepts to be able to make my future projects even more responsive.
